# mega trolling for all da hosters

## This list contains all the IDs I've collected from the time I've spent hosting, it won't stop all the bots but it will atleast assist in getting most of them.
This also includes a lot of the hosters aswell.

*and yes, including the EU hosters (sorry not sorry)*

**For all the degenerates I've seen in the cheating community, I want to thank the small few that managed to avoid that cess-pool.
You know who you are, and thank you. If it wasn't for this shitty place, I would've never found interest in coding to begin with.**

Being able to find something you can honestly be proud of is such a dopamine rush. I never really cared for the actual hosting part, but the programming side (or the video editing side :D )

***For instance, I have a mad respect for people like [Milenko](https://github.com/incontestableness), sure he was purely anti-bot, but his dedication to the project was very inspiring.***

Hell, even all the random kids who made their own CH forks were a little inspiring. Starting off where I started and just building up.

Honestly though, if you host or cheat on anything, you need to just take a break and think about what you are doing and how you could be spending your time differently.

__I'm not here to be your father figure, but there's a point where even you have to wonder if what you are doing has any meaning/purpose.__

I mean I basically already thanked the members of this group, but if you guys never found me, I would've most likely fallen victim to the cess pool due to an altered mental state.

Q, R, S, A, I, and of course V. <sub>(Abbreviated for privacy)</sub> You all have my thanks and respect for being there when I first showed up. Especially Q for just trusting me without really knowing me.

<sub>I will note that I very much miss our schizo sessions...</sub>

## To N3U ##

I have no idea if this dude will ever even see this, but I am truly sorry for what I did.

Maybe later on you'll realize how bad the cheating scene was for you, but I couldn't just watch you throwing yourself at every pedo in this shit community.

I will admit that what I did may have been over the top with every account being deleted (steam,email,discord,etc).

I will absolutely accept any judgement of that, but never forget that I only did it to get you away from this place. It was not at ***ALL*** healthy for you.

I hope one of these days we can reconnect and talk about what happened. Even though it happened so long ago, it still lingers in my mind.
